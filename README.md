## Description
This weeks challenge was to complete supplied scripting , to create a daily task schedule that had the capability for the user to enter a task for a given hour, save the task and have it be stored into local storage. This permits the user to return to the page after refreshing and still have the contents that were added be persistent. Additionally the implementation of a live calendar date heading was added to the page that utilizes the DayJs API to continuously check the date and update automatically for the users convenience.Lastly the effect implemented through JavaScript would append the background color of hours that have past and what remains, so that on quick glance, the user can refer to what portion of the workday they are in.


## Learning Experience
During the process of completing this script, implementing different APIs was a new experience, while we covered it in class, using it on this project helped reinforce their usage. At several points while working on this weeks assignment, I found myself making digressions as I explored the documentation for the different APIs. I had a few revelatory moments while reading them that helped me to better understand some of the foundational items we have worked on in the past weeks. 

The difficulties I encountered in this weeks challenge surrounded the combination of Jquery functions, with the implementation of the DayJs API and writing the script that checked the current hour and appended the contents depending on the hour of the day. This built on an "if/else" statement, however the complexity of each else statement was far more technical than what I have encountered so far into the class. So some independent study was prompted when navigating how to structure these elements. 

Some minor practice in function testing was also used during the process of developing this app based on past input from graders and interactions with askBCS.
